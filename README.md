### Summary sources

- [Census Data Portal](https://data.census.gov) portal to US Census information (major source of demographics)
- [Sage Data](https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/databases/data-planet) compilation of official summary statistics
- [Statista](https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/databases/statista) quick lookup of current facts

### Datasets (data not in summary form)

This is only a tiny selection.  Most data questions are very individualized and depend on finding the right producer of the data.
